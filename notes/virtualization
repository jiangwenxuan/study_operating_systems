Process:

mechanisms and policies

C's stack: local variables, function parameters, return addresses

C's heap: dynamically-allocated data

process states: running, ready, blocked

fork(), wait(), and exec()



Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution:

user mode and kernel mode

use trap instruction

use timer interrupt to help os maintain control of the machine

during a timer interrupt or system call, use context switch to change process
